# House-price-prediction
## Model Summary & Performance  

This project uses a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, location, furnishing, and overall condition.  

###  Steps taken:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, standardized column names, encoded categorical variables).  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
- Trained a **Linear Regression model** on the training data.  
- Evaluated the model using **R² score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  

###  Performance:
- The **Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of ~0.8**, meaning it explains about **80% of the variance in house prices**.  
- The predicted prices showed a strong alignment with actual prices in the test set.  

 This demonstrates that even a simple Linear Regression model can provide meaningful insights into house price prediction when the data is properly cleaned and prepared.
